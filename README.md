# Summary 
A simple robo friend landing page that is built with React js and tachyons for styling. I initially built it using the built in state management by react then i refactored it using Redux for state management, and redux-thunk for asynchronous redux. I used some array method for the search functionality on the search bar.

## Technologies Used
* React.
* Tachyons.
* Redux.
* Redux-Thunk.
